# MobileNet v1/v2 + SkipNet

The purpose of the project is to create a model capable of real-time semantic segmentation with sufficient accuracy to estime the drivable surface and the obstacles in front of the vehicle. This repository will act as a continuous documentation for the project.

## The Goal
---
Most of the research on semantic segmentation is focusing on increasing the accuracy of the models while computationally efficient solutions are hard to find and many times huge compromises have to be made.

Since the goal is clear that we are looking at basic autonomous driving, the model only needs adequate accuracy on the road, boundary and obstacle (this can be expanded) labels so we can estimate our drivable surface.

To achieve this goal, I will try to implement a custom architecture with separate feature extraction and decoder modules. The inspiration for this work comes from [this paper](#realtime).

After the model is done, optimization will be done with TensorRT to achieve the fastest inference speed possible for the model so it can be used for testing in autonomous vehicles.

The feature extractor will be a modified Inception architecture  ([MobileNet v1](#mobile1) and [MobileNet v2](#mobile2)). The main difference is that [Inception V3](#inception) uses standard convolution while MobileNet employs depthwise separable convolution while The decoder will follow the standard FCN-8 architecture([SkipNet](#fcn8)) 

## Tools
---
The main tool used during the project is Google's TensorFlow, with consideration to the supported operations recommendation in the [TensorRT documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tf-trt-user-guide/index.html#supported-ops).

The aforementioned TensorRT by NVIDIA will serve as the optimizer to achieve faster inference.

For training and fine-tuning the models, 3 GeForce RTX 2080 GPUs are used simultaneously. Recommendations for the multi GPU training are used from [this Google Brain study](#googlebrain) (synchronous data parallelism)
